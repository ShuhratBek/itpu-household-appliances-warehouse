# Guide for the Course Project Implementation

## Stage

### Task Clarification
Term: 2 days

#### Recommendations
- [ ] Receive and analyze the task
- [ ] Clarify details and requirements with the mentor
- [ ] Propose a 10-week work plan for course project development
- [ ] Create a progress report and place it in your repository

### Analysis
Term: 3 days

#### Recommendations
- [ ] Study the applied area by the individual task
- [ ] Define and describe the basic functionality that needs to be implemented first (MVPâ€”minimum viable product)
- [ ] Describe additional functionality for improving usability, security, performance, etc. 
- [ ] Describe any advanced functionality that might be useful in the future

### Use cases
Term: 4 days

#### Recommendations
- [ ] Describe several options for using the program (how the program should behave from the user's point of view) however you prefer.

### Search for solutions
Term: 1 week

#### Recommendations
- [ ] Analyze the methodological material and choose the architecture
- [ ] Explore examples
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with additional materials using the sources provided
- [ ] Examine the benefits of layered architecture

### Software development
Term: 6 weeks

#### Recommendations
- [ ] Create a prototype:
  - [ ] Implement a program with minimal functionality
  - [ ] Check the functionality and correct errors
  - [ ] Define functionality that will further improve the prototype
- [ ] Consistently improve the prototype, taking into account the planned functionality and deadlines
- [ ] Gradually complete the progress report

### Development Completion
Term: 1 week

#### Recommendations
- [ ] Check the previously described use cases and note any inconsistencies as well as the reasons (e.g., improved, abandoned, not implemented on time, etc.). 
- [ ] Check and estimate (in percent) the progress in implementing the planned basic, additional, and advanced functionality. Specify reasons for any discrepancies found. 
- [ ] Describe your software's demonstration scenario. Focus on the most successful aspects of the implementation. Record a video to demonstrate your application and provide it to the mentor.

### Presentation
Term: 1 day

#### Recommendations
- [ ] Demonstrate your application
- [ ] Show its advantages and disadvantages
- [ ] Provide recommendations for improvement
- [ ] Answer questions about functionality and implementation
